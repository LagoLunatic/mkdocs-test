## Older Releases

You can find download links for older versions of the randomizer on [the release history page](release-history.md).  

These builds are outdated and lack newer features and bug fixes, so using them is not recommended unless you have a specific reason to.  

## Development Build

If you want to try out the cutting-edge features that have just been added to the randomizer, you can download a [dev build](https://nightly.link/LagoLunatic/wwrando/workflows/python-app/master).  
Be warned that these builds have not been properly tested and **may have serious bugs that prevent you from completing the game**.  

If you encounter an issue on a dev build, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando/issues) if no one else has reported it first.
