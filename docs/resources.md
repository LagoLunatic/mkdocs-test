## Getting Started

To play Wind Waker Randomizer, you need three things:

- An ISO of the North American GameCube version of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which you can rip from your own disk by following [this guide.](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games)
- A way to play GameCube games, such as [Dolphin](https://en.dolphin-emu.org/download/) for PC/Android, or [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) for Wii.
- The Wind Waker Randomizer program itself (PC only), which can be downloaded [here.](download.md)

!!! note
    It is not recommended to use RetroArch or a legacy build of Dolphin, as they are both very outdated. Use a recent beta or development build of Dolphin instead.

## Learning to Play

[wooferzfg's TWW Randomizer Tracker](http://www.wooferzfg.me/tww-rando-tracker/)  
This tool is highly recommended. It allows you to keep track of which locations you've already visited on a seed and tells you which locations locations you have left to check.  

[JarheadHME's Randomized Secret Caves Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mPhzoxL0wAPs7-a5Q1tM5AOx5jpb3lx9/view)  
A reference for telling similar Secret Caves apart from one another when you have the Secret Cave Entrance Randomizer enabled.
