# Wind Waker Randomizer

This is a randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

It shuffles all of the items in the game so that each playthrough is unique. You never know where a particular item will be!

It also makes various other changes to the game to increase replayability:  
You're allowed to go anywhere on the sea from the start, turning the game into a nonlinear open world experience.  
Most cutscenes are removed, and sailing speed and text speed are both increased.

Additionally, it comes with several other optional randomization features, such as shuffling the entrances that lead into dungeons between one other.
