# Getting Started

## What You'll Need

To play Wind Waker Randomizer, you need three things:

- An ISO of the North American GameCube version of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. You can rip this from your own disk by following [this guide.](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games)
- A way to play GameCube games, such as [Dolphin](https://en.dolphin-emu.org/download/) for PC/Android, or [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) for Wii.
- The Wind Waker Randomizer program itself (PC only), which can be downloaded [here.](download.md)

!!! note
    It is not recommended to use RetroArch or a legacy build of Dolphin, as they are both very outdated.  
    Use a recent beta or development build of Dolphin instead.  

## Extracting

Once you've downloaded the randomizer, you first need to extract it from its compressed folder before you can use it. On Windows this can be done by right-clicking the .zip file you downloaded, selecting "Extract All...", and then clicking the "Extract" button.  
Now that it's extracted, you can double click the "Wind Waker Randomizer" program to run it.  

!!! note
    Don't try to run the randomizer while it's still inside of the .zip. You will get an error.

## Using the Randomizer

Once you've launched the randomizer program, you will need to select your vanilla Wind Waker ISO mentioned at the start. Click "Browse" to the right of `Vanilla Wind Waker ISO` and select the correct file - it usually ends in the .iso extension.

The randomizer won't overwrite your ISO when you randomize it. Instead, it will produce a new ISO you can play separately.  

The next step is to tell the randomizer where this new randomized ISO should be placed. To do this, click "Browse" to the right of `Randomized Output Folder` and pick any folder you want.  

You might want to customize which settings are selected before randomizing, but you can also just leave the default settings on, as those tend to be good for first time players.

Now you can randomize the game! To do this, click the "Randomize" button at the very bottom right of the program and wait a minute.
Once it's done, you can find the new randomized ISO in the `Randomized Output Folder` you picked earlier. You can play this ISO with Dolphin or Nintendont just like a regular GameCube ISO.

That's it, have fun!
